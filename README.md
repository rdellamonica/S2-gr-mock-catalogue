# A mock catalogue for the S2 star

We have produced a mock catalogue for the S2 star in the Galactic Centre, considering a relativistic orbital model in a Schwarzschild spacetime (assuming that SgrA* is a non rotating black hole described by General Relativity) and generated simulated astrometric positions and radial velocity measurements as could be potentially measured by the GRAVITY instrument at VLT in next four orbital periods of S2.

The catalogue has been built by numerically integrating the geodesic equation with the package [PyGRO](https://github.com/rdellamonica/pygro).
